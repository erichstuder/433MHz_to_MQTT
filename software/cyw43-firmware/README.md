# WiFi + Bluetooth firmware blobs

Copied from embassy: https://github.com/embassy-rs/embassy/tree/f58efe9c6297ede1e813d702f60d90745530cb51/cyw43-firmware

The embassy people obtained it from: https://github.com/georgerobotics/cyw43-driver/tree/main/firmware

There the binary data is in h-files.  
How did the embassy people exactly create these binaries?  
It works...

Thank you!
